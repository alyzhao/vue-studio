		"尊敬的2050志愿者们，",
		"这是一个激动人心的时代，不只是因为互联网的出现以及人类有了移民火星的可能。",
		"这是一个全球年青人比任何时候多的时代，世界人口的50%在30岁以下，还有什么能比这个更令人激动？",
		"很多很多年前，我博士毕业在学校工作，对年青人好像没有什么感觉。",
		"很多年前，在微软亚洲研究院工作，周围有同事入选MIT Technology Review 35，我也刚过了被入选的年纪，顿时让我感觉还真有年青人那么一回事。",
		"多年前，创办阿里云的时候，和一批视ACM竞赛为乐趣的年青人一起工作，虽然我年纪长他们100%。他们用“飞天”代码告诉我，没有年青人，就不会有阿里云。",
		"几年前，博客园的小伙伴来到了云栖小镇，我有机会近距离看到了近百万年青人留在博客园上的足迹，让我明白了每个人都知道的一个普通道理，未来是年青人的。",
		"我以为，追逐年青人是最伟大的梦想。我以为，追逐年青人就是人类对未来的自信。",
		"这也是最挑战的时代，城市发展问题、疾病问题、环境问题，过去留给了未来许多问题，世界自然地把未来的挑战留给了年青人。如果给年青人一个选择的机会，他们会选择留在地球，让地球变得更美好，而不是移民去火星，因为前者更具挑战。去火星只是年青人出外旅行的选择之一，这样的选择，只有年青人才能做到。",
		"这就有了2050大会。它是一个年青人的大会，让年青人站在聚光灯下，用年青人的方式谈创新，用年青人的方式看未来，用年青人的方式面对挑战。",
		"不同的年青人在这里团聚，既是ACMer与博客园的程序员的团聚，也是MIT TR 35与达沃斯世界经济论坛新生代青年领军者的团聚，更是来自不同领域胸怀同样梦想的青年科学家的团聚。",
		"这里，年青人会用最年青人的方式表达对世界的担当、对未来的承诺。",
		"这里，挑战离年青人更近，年青人心中的未来一定就是世界的未来。",
		"为年青人开一个大会，让世界各地最有创新动力的年青人相互交流，这件事在我心中酝酿已久。当我跟许多不同背景、不同经历的人交流这个想法，几乎每个人都产生了强烈的共鸣，令我振奋。",
		"我们非常幸运，在杭州市云栖科技创新基金会的倡议下，2018年，来自五湖四海的一群志愿者聚在了云栖小镇，共同发起了2050大会。我们有一个共同的愿景，让世界各地的年青人因科技而团聚，2050因此成了这群人的公益事业。",
		"也因为有了这些志愿者，2050有了巨大的包容性，大家用共同的愿景和初心，在创造一个与众不同的大会同时，也会让云栖小镇成为离全世界年青人最近的地方。",
		"“志愿”是2050的一道靓丽风景。参与的每一个人都用年青人的方式定义了“志愿”，其中包括了极客邦科技和新华社“新青年”的一群90后。作为一位曾经的年青人，2050是我能为世界的50%做一点贡献所做出的最重要的选择，我深知为这50%做的任何事就是对世界100%的贡献。",
		"2050代表了我们对未来的期待和想象。",
		"年青人是不一样的，他们来自世界不同的地方，说着不同的语言，热爱不同的科学和技术，怀揣不同的梦想。",
		"年青人是一样的，他们都是没有伞的孩子，他们喜欢在雨中奔跑。",
		"到云栖，一起在雨中奔跑。"

		"This is an exhilarating time, not just because of the arrival of the internet or the possibility of colonizing Mars.",
		"This is the youngest generation in history. 50% of the world’s population is under 30 years old. What could be more exciting?",
		"Many, many years ago, I was working at the university after I had graduated from my PhD program. At that time, I had no particular feelings for young people in general. ",
		"Several years ago, when I was founding Alibaba Cloud, I was working with a group of young people who held great passion for ACM/ICPC, most of them were only half of my age. The code of Apsara showed me that there would be no Alibaba Cloud without young people. ",
		"A few years ago, the cnblogs.com team came to Yunqi and I got a chance to observe the footprints of nearly a million youngsters on cnblogs. This allowed me to understand something that everyone already knows:the future belongs to the young.",
		"I believe that chasing youth is the greatest dream of humanity, and chasing the younger generation is our confidence in the future. ",
		"This generation also faces the most challenges: urban development, epidemic diseases, environmental degradation, there are so many problems from yesterday that have been handed down to tomorrow. The world has no choice but to leave future challenges to young people. If you give the youngsters a chance, they would choose the Earth to make it a better place, than escaping to Mars to face the more challenging possibilities. For them, going to Mars is just a way to travel but not a way to evade. Therefore, the 2050 Conference was created.",
		"It is a conference aimed at young people. It will allow young people to stand in the spotlight, talk about innovation, look towards the future and face the challenges with a young mind.",
		"It will be a grand gathering of youth, a gathering of ACMers and cnblogs programmers, a gathering of MIT TR 35 and the Davos WEF’s Young Leaders and Global Shapers, a gathering for the next generation scientists from various fields of expertise.",
		"Here, the young generation will show their responsibility to the world and their promise for the future.",
		"Here, challenges will be closer to young people, letting the future they dream about become the world’s future.",
		"For a long time, I have been thinking about bringing together the world’s most innovative young people to exchange ideas. When I discussed, this idea with many people who have different experiences and backgrounds, almost everyone showed their excitement and gave me great encouragement.",
		"In 2018, a group of volunteers gather at Yunqi to kickoff the 2050 Conference as an enthusiastic response to the proposal by the Hangzhou Yunqi Science and Technology Innovation Foundation. ",
		"We have a shared vision - to make this gathering where the world’s youth embrace science and technology. 2050 Conference has for this reason become a shared volunteer project for all of us.",
		"And this makes 2050 even more welcoming and diverse. While we spare efforts to build a unique event, we are also making the Yunqi the place closest to the youth.",
		"“Volunteership” is one of the most wonderful aspects of 2050 Conference. All contributors are defining “volunteership” in their own way, including the young people from Geekbang and Xinhua YouthTalks. As a young person before, 2050 is my humble contribution to 50% of the world. I believe that anything I can do for this 50% is a contribution for 100% of the world’s population.",
		"2050 represents our hopes and imagination for the future. ",
		"Young people are different. They come from different countries, speak different languages, embrace different technologies, and have different dreams.",
		"But in other ways, young people are all the same. They are children who don’t have umbrellas and like to run in the rain.",
		"At Yunqi, we’ll run in the rain together."
